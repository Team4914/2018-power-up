# 2018-power-up
Ready for whatever FIRST can throw at us this year.  
Hopefully.

## Before you commit:
* Learn how to write good commit messages and maintain the integrity of this repository by reading [this useful guide](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams.  
* Do not commit more than one change. Instead, each commit should be representative of a single change.  
* Code should work at every commit so that if anything needs to be reverted, we won't have everything broken.  
* If you're in the nine out of ten times where the code doesn't work, elaborate in the body of the commit message.  
* Experiments should be carried out in branches, and merged with the main branch only when it works and is decidedly a welcome addition to the final robot code.
