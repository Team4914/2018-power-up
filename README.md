# 2018-power-up
Ready for whatever FIRST can throw at us this year.  
Hopefully.

## If you're new to GitHub and Git:
For most people, a GUI is easiest to use. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKr8lbx3uFY) in this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h9_cB9mPT8&list=PLqGj3iMvMa4LFz8DZ0t-89twnelpT4Ilw) to learn how to use it.  
If you don't mind using a command line, watch everything in this great tutorial by The Net Ninja, found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjQznt-8kE&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9goXbgTDQ0n_4TBzOO0ocPR).

## Before you commit:
* Learn how to write good commit messages and maintain the integrity of this repository by reading [this useful guide](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams.  
* Do not commit more than one change. Instead, each commit should be representative of a single change.  
* Code should work at every commit so that if anything needs to be reverted, we won't have everything broken.  
* If you're in the nine out of ten times where the code doesn't work, elaborate in the body of the commit message.  
* Experiments should be carried out in branches, and merged with the main branch only when it works and is decidedly a welcome addition to the final robot code.
